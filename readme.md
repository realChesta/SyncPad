# SyncPad
SyncPad is an online collaborative editor capable of editing in two modes:
* RTF mode: rich text editing with support for images, videos, etc.
* Code mode: syntax-highlighted code editor with code folding, autocomplete and more.

## Getting things to work
To run the server, navigate to the `build` directory and run `main.js` with node.js.
